1. Research Question
2. Segregate the data according to the Question - big part guessing
3. Answer the research question with detail - report part, while describing what we did and how we did it

Variables - Rainfall, Evaporation, Min temp, Max temp - (sunshine?)

# First Step
Use Melbourne, Sydney to fill up Brisbane
Use all 3 to fill up Adelaide

# Second Step
What are we trying to do?
Use Min/Max temp and Evaporation to evaluate the rainfall in each major cities in each states. 
Does temperature affect the rainfall prediction compared to evaporation

Do we have the data set to compare results - no? but we will do random sampling to extract a few data points out to test out our conclusion

Individual conclusion? - each conclusion for each city
Does the location affect our outcome?

If not - combine
If does - separate

Try both and see what happens... - good discussion topic in the final report

Multi regression
Linear regression
Do both?

Assumptions :
1. Each major cities' weather condition is neglected - to combine all the cities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New/Final Question - Predicting price demand (unit?) based on temperature per state (9am, 3pm)

Major city's data will represent its state


Report Sesh
1. Evaporation and Rainfall doesn't work together
