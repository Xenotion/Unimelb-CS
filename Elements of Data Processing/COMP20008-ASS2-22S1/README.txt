# Introduction of intended use for code

This code is intended only for research purposes. It explores the relationship 
between energy demand and temperature using plots and regression techniques. Linear 
Regression and Polynomial Regression were used as our regression techniques with 
a training-test split and K-fold Cross Validation to increase accuracy.

# File structure and use of each file

There are 2 main datasets which contain the price demand dataset as well as the weather 
information of 4 cities (Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney). These files are required
to ensure the code runs properly.
3 graphs have been exported from the code to the graphs sub-directory

# Instructions on how to run your code.

There is a singular file to run named Project.ipynb
1. Make sure the datasets are loaded up and contains the right path while 
reading the CSV file.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook in order to ensure variables are configured chronologically and
libraries are imported before their use
